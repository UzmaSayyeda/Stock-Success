# Stock Market Dashboard

## Project Overview

Our project is designed to provide investors with comprehensive and up-to-date information on the top-performing stocks across various sectors like energy, materials, industrials, utilities, healthcare, financials, consumer goods, IT, communication, and real estate. We offer an interactive dashboard that presents daily open and close stock data, as well as a range of charts that reflect the day change, candlestick graphs, and heat maps based on the biggest stock movers per industry that allow users to easily visualize trends and identify potential opportunities. Our platform is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for investors of all levels to access the information they need to make informed decisions

## Usage and Installation Instructions of Libraries/Tools

## Introduction 

Our project Stock-Success analyzes real live data from Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) stock market sectors. From each of the major industries we choose to analyze two competing stocks. The results are several interactive graphs that allow the user to pick from a dropdown menu two stocks and their accompanying data. Other widgets present the user with news updates and live stock market updates.

## Project Goals and How We Achieved Them

The project aims to create an interactive stock market dashboard. Goals were determined by alloted working time during class. First, finding an API and creating a database to store data. By the end of the second class period a Python Flask API had been craeted that returned data to index.html. The second week, the team focused on creating the accompanying visualization: a line chart, candlestick, and OHLC. When the most important goals had been achieved, we moved to target the small details that make the stock market dashboard user friendly. A dark-mode setting was created, a drop-down menu was added allowing the user to view only one graph at a time, and other widgets were also added. Everything was achieved through organization, time-management, and colaboration.

## Data Processing/Gathering

The data was gathered from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance python library. For this project, we chose to analyze New York Stock Exchange OHLC data the past 5 years. We then had to specify which stocks/tickers we were looking to analyze. It was our goal to choose stocks in a uniform matter and to do this we chose the two stocks with the highest **volume** within each major sector. As seen in the table below, we had a total of 18 different stocks among 9 different sectors.

| Sector  | Stock (NYSE) |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Energy  | Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)  |
| Energy  | Chevron Corporation (CVX)  |
| Materials  | The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW)  |
| Materials  |  DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (DD)  |
| Industrials  | United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)  |
| Industrials  | Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX)  |
| Utilities  | Duke Energy Corporation (DUK)  |
| Utilities  | Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED)  |
| Healthcare  | Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  |
| Healthcare  | Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  |
| Consumer Goods  | Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)  |
| Consumer Goods  | McDonald's Corporation (MCD)  |
| Consumer Defensive  | The Coca-Cola Company (KO)  |
| Consumer Defensive  | The Procter & Gamble Company (PG)  |
| Technology  | Apple Inc. (AAPL)  |
| Technology  | Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)  |
| Communication Services  | Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)  |
| Communication Services  | Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)  |  


The data was then cleaned and stored in a database using Pandas and SQLAlchemy. The data was then returned to the ```index.html``` file using a Python Flask API. The data was then used to create the visualizations using Plotly.

## Conclusion

From our data, we can conclude that the stock market was growing in 2019. In 2020, which coincides with COVID-19 pandemic, the stock market took a massive hit. That is not to say that all industries in the stock market were negatively affected, however. Healthcare giants J&J and Pfizer maintained stability during this period, whereas Exxon and Chevron shrunk due to travel restrictions, yielding an overall decrease in demand to do so. Most of our sample stocks appeared to recover after the pandemic (i.e. Consolidated Edison and Duke Energy), but ongoing government policies still play a role in the strength of various stocks. One example is the federal governmentâ€™s decision to maintain a target interest rate in order to both help alleviate inflation and prevent another recession.
